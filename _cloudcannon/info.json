The following are the most typical ones.</p><h1>Educator</h1><p>When it comes to making a difference in the world, educators have been on top of the list. Two years ago, I aspired to be an educator and successfully landed a part-time teaching job at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://nau.edu/\">Northern Arizona University (NAU)</a>&nbsp;and later a full-time position at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amsschools.org/\">Academy of Math and Science (AMS)</a>, a K-8 school in Phoenix, Arizona, United States.&nbsp;</p><p>As an educator, it has always been my passion and determination to enlighten students and help them capture the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments. They also reminded me of capturing my sparkles and pushing my limits higher. These years, I have gradually solidified my interests and passion in the cocktail of linguistics &amp; computer science, especially data science and natural language processing (NLP).</p><h1>Language Enthusiast &amp; Translator</h1><p>I found myself passionate in languages at a young age, when I quickly picked up dialects that my family members were speaking - <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Chinese\">Xiang Chinese</a> (also with different variations: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha\">Urban Changsha</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxiang\">Ningxiang</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangtan\">Xiangtan</a>) and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese\">Cantonese</a>. In middle school, I started to expose myself to a second foreign language (French) and I started to learn it systematically when I was in college. I am learning Spanish and Finnish at the moment. By obtaining my first master's degree in Translation at the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html\">Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a>, I also honed my skills in translation and interpretation. I am happy to have worked for <strong>Arizona State University (ASU), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and PAC-12</strong> with Arizona State University, and for&nbsp;<strong>French Institute</strong> with Embassy of France in China, as well as other organizations when I was working part-time as a translator and interpreter.</p><h1>Linguist &amp; Programmer</h1><p>My never-ending interests in computers date back to my childhood, when my parents opened a new <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium\">Pentium III</a> computer right from the box. At the age of 6, excited and surprised, I started my journey to fiddle around with my new toy. I started coding in Python 2.x when I was in high school. At <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/\">Hunan University (HNU)</a> in China, I was working part-time as a Full Stack Developer in 1000 Internet and Culture Studio (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://weibo.com/qiannianxiange\"><em>link is in Chinese</em></a>), a student-operated studio. In Spring 2021 at NAU, I was fortunate to take&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://directory.nau.edu/person/jae89\">Programming for Text Analysis with Dr. Egbert</a>, and it reignited my passion for integrating computer science and linguistics. Presently, as a Foreign Language Teacher in Phoenix, I always strive to make a tight integration of my current job and future envisions. Elected as the Director of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/amssmrobotics/home\">AMS South Mountain Robotics and Programming Club</a>, I am actively playing a leading role in the Club started in January 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Propelled by ambition and desire to become a computational linguist, I also keep sharpening my coding and data analysis skills (Python &amp; R) on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/\">DataCamp</a>&nbsp;and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.udemy.com\">Udemy</a>. Meanwhile, I have also taught myself algorithms and statistical methods regarding NLP and computational linguistics. I am also glad I have been, once again, an active <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/logreg-n-coffee\">GitHub stargazer and user</a> since the end of 2021.</p><p>For more information, please check out my <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/logreg-n-coffee/academic_cv/blob/main/cv.pdf\">CV</a>.
